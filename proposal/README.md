# Proposal instructions

For the proposal, you should edit the file `proposal.tex`. 
We haven't explicitly discussed TeX in class yet, but if you have both
TeX and make installed, you can run `$ make` to build the PDF.  I've added
the built PDF to the .gitignore file, so you won't be able to commit
the built PDF.  Instead, just commit the changes to `proposal.tex`
and push your commits to GitHub by the deadline.

The proposal that you will submit on Thursday (10/1/15) by 21:00 must contain
at least two paragraphs. The first will reference which paper & data set(s) you
are planning on using for the project. You should do some preliminary work to
guarantee that you can access and load the data, and report on it in the 
proposal.

In the remainder of the proposal, your group must present what you plan to do
with the data you've chosen. This is entirely up to you; some examples for what
you might do are given in `proposal.tex`. Note that you are not expected to 
have done any of the analysis yet (aside from loading and understanding the
data), but you must present a clear plan for the analysis you intend to do.

These proposals are not just busy-work; they will be reviewed and you will be
given feedback by the instructors. If your proposal is too vague or you 
propose to do too much, the instructors will comment and you may need to 
revise your proposal. Note that this is good practice for submitting research
proposals in the wild.
