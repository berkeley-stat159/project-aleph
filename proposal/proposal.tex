\maketitle

Identify a published fMRI paper and the accompanying data
\cite{lindquist2008statistical}.  You should explain the basic idea of the
paper in a paragraph.  You should also perform basic sanity check on the data
(e.g., can you downloaded, can you load the files, confirm that you have the
correct number of subjects).

Briefly explain what approach you intend to take for exploring
the data and paper.  If you intend to ``reproduce'' some aspect of the paper,
explain in exactly what sense you mean to do this.  If you are thinking about
validating the data describe the assumpution used in the analysis and indicate
how you might check them.
